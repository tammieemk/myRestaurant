    <div id="mini-autobiography">
        As I grew older I came across several hobbies which brings me joy and comfort.
        I am greatful to have been blessed with the talent of art.
        I am the last born of a family of six. I was born and raised with Nigerian intellect
        and I became extremely creative and I strive for greatness in everything I set my mind to.
        I have created, crafted and produced various art pieces-mostly sketches- throughout her life using various
        muses, inspirations, references and my wonderful imagination. Using art as a way to express the feelings words
        could not express and my feeligs to the fullest.

    </div>
    <div id="mini-autobiography">
        I am always crafting something up, always ready and set with a sketchbook to sketch out and idea that comes
        to mind. I will be an amazing photographer someday, {but right now my skills are quite average} being aware
        surroundings and the beauty of the environment as well as the individuals in them I try to make my photographs
        capture how they look in my mind. I use Photography as a way to show the world how things are portrayed like in
        mind.
        Being a lover of nature and its exquisite sights, I am a young upcoming artist who would love to display some of
        my
        work at important places.
